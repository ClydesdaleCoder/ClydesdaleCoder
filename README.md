- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClydesdaleCoder, you have found my Github, congratulations on the Discovery!
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, virtualization and anything Digital Cinema related. I am in the process of building my own personal server and writing scripts to administrate it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash and Python. I am also working on getting my Net+ at the moment as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with the tools I plan to use. That varies from ProxMox OS to even tools such as Tripwire and WireShark. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He\Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My name comes from my stature IRL
